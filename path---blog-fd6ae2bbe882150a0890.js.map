I sourced the buttons (which I love) and made belly bands incorporating the twine in order to make assembling the invites easier for Kathy and George. I sized the invitations at 4&#215;6 inches, once assembled and I think that size suited the style of her invitations.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-112 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"653\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5.jpeg 1000w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5-300x196.jpeg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5-768x502.jpeg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>I made the main invite colour Ivory with an accent colour matching the bridesmaid dresses, with some darker tones as well. I think in the end Kathy&#8217;s Invitations were romantic and soft and really suited her and George.

We’d say to post them <strong>at least 6 months</strong> before the big day. This allows for your guests to book their flights and make the necessary travel and accommodation arrangements as soon as possible.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; POSTING YOUR INVITATIONS</strong></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"image-subtitle sqs-dynamic-text\\\" data-width-percentage=\\\"35.3\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_11_1496142026617_10845\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-300x200.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-1024x683.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>For a local wedding, we’d recommend you send your full day invitations around <strong>2-3 months </strong>or<strong> 10-15 weeks</strong> in advance of your wedding (minimum). We also highly recommend that you have a “<em>Respond by</em>” date either on your invitations or on your RSVP cards (usually <strong>6 weeks</strong> before your wedding). Some people might ignore it and inevitably you will get some late replies but having a date in mind gives people a deadline to work by. Your venue will usually require your final numbers by a certain date (usually <strong>4 weeks</strong> prior to your wedding) so make sure you keep this in mind too when thinking of when to send your invitations and what dates to have replies by. For example if your wedding was in late September, we’d recommend you send out your invitations at the end of June with a reply date by the beginning of August. This gives your guests ample time to reply.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; EVENING INVITATIONS</strong></p>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1496142026617_104306\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<p>It is <strong>your prerogative</strong>, when you choose to send out your evening reception invitations (if you need them). Sometimes especially if you are worried about making up minimum numbers it is advisable to post your evening invitations slightly later than your full day ones. This means that depending on the number of &#8220;decline&#8221; responses you receive, you can invite some of your evening guests to the full day to make up numbers. To ease the worry about minimum numbers, I’d recommend over-compensating and inviting more to the full day than you actually require to come in the first place. Give or take, around 10-20% of guests you invite will decline, so bear this in mind. You can also send them out at the same time as your full day invitations. This is a good idea for couples that have over estimated their number of full day guests and so who aren’t too worried about meeting minimum numbers. Our advice would be to start with posting out the full day invitations, and you can always send evening invites as and when you wish, usually up to a week before your wedding.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; &#8220;ON THE DAY&#8221; STATIONERY</strong></p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-55\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd-249x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"249\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd-249x300.jpg 249w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd.jpg 589w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\\\" /></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_6_1496142026617_63773\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\\\" data-block-type=\\\"47\\\">\\n<p>Now I can only speak for Creative Wedding Company, but usually we require your final details at least <strong>4-5 weeks</strong> before your wedding. If you know your menus or details for favour tags etc, (i.e. nothing with names) we’d recommend getting those details to us as soon as possible beforehand so we can have those ready to go for you.</p>\\n<p>Regarding seating plans and place names, we ask that you send us those as soon as you know them so we can start printing them for you. A<strong> minimum of 3 weeks</strong> in advance of your wedding would suffice but the sooner the better really. This gives us ample time to get everything printed and assembled and the finishing touches added for your big day.</p>\\n<p>We will deliver all of your “<em>On the Day</em>” stationery <strong>7-10 days</strong> before your wedding, or earlier in exceptional circumstances.</p>\\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1496142026617_123735\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>12 &#8211; 18 months : </strong>Contact a stationery vendor and finalise ideas with your partner.</li>\\n<li><strong>9 &#8211; 12 months : </strong>Post Save the Dates</li>\\n<li><strong>6</strong> <strong>months (min)</strong> : Post invitations (Destination Weddings)</li>\\n<li><strong>2 &#8211; 3</strong> <strong>months (min)</strong> : Post Full Day (and/or Evening) Invitations <em>N.B.</em> – Put a “<em>Respond By</em>” Date on your RSVP cards for at least 6 weeks before your wedding, as venues usually require final numbers 4 weeks prior to your date.</li>\\n<li><strong>3 &#8211; 5 weeks</strong> &#8211; Send your stationery vendor the necessary final information for your “<em>On the Day</em>” Stationery i.e. Table names, seating plan arrangements, guest names for place cards and so on.</li>\\n<li><strong>7 &#8211; 10 days</strong> – Your &#8220;On the Day&#8221; stationery will be delivered to your house or a required location.

Seeing as they had just welcomed the adorable baby Nancy into the family a few months before, I decided to include her in the illustration also as she&#8217;d (in Kathy&#8217;s words) &#8220;be centre of attention&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-111 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-5.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"694\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-5.jpeg 1000w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-5-300x208.jpeg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-5-768x533.jpeg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>She had seen an image of an invitation she liked, and wanted something quite rustic, in a pocket-fold style with hessian twine and a wooden heart button on the front. I sourced the buttons (which I love) and made belly bands incorporating the twine in order to make assembling the invites easier for Kathy and George. I sized the invitations at 4&#215;6 inches, once assembled and I think that size suited the style of her invitations.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-112 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"653\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5.jpeg 1000w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5-300x196.jpeg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-5-768x502.jpeg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>I made the main invite colour Ivory with an accent colour matching the bridesmaid dresses, with some darker tones as well. I think in the end Kathy&#8217;s Invitations were romantic and soft and really suited her and George. They in turn were thrilled with the work and I also had the pleasure of creating their evening invitations, and their orders of service for them. I hope that they had a magical day and pass on my congratulations to them for their newest arrival, little Lyla.</p>\\n<h3>LOUISE XX</h3>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-113 size-full\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-3.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"720\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-3.jpeg 720w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-3-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-3-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-3-100x100.jpeg 100w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\\\" /></p>\\n<div id=\\\"yui_3_17_2_1_1521998292899_2525\\\" class=\\\"row sqs-row\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"yui_3_17_2_1_1521998292899_2567\\\" class=\\\"col sqs-col-6 span-6\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_46_1494450011289_57123\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<h3>CREDITS :  STATIONERY PHOTOGRAPHS :<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/\\\">CWC</a> </strong>| VENUE : THE<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.galgorm.com/\\\">GALGORM RESORT &amp; SPA</a></strong></h3>\\n<h1 class=\\\"text-align-center\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/wedding-stationery/\\\">have your big day, your way</a></h1>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"yui_3_17_2_1_1521998292899_2639\\\" class=\\\"row sqs-row\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"yui_3_17_2_1_1521998292899_2638\\\" class=\\\"col sqs-col-12 span-12\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_12_1511352495000_12029\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\\\" data-block-type=\\\"47\\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\",\"excerpt\":\"<p>Kathy and George 11TH AUGUST 2016 / THE GALGORM RESORT &amp; SPA, BALLYMENA RUSTIC INVITATION DESIGN &amp; ORDERS OF SERVICE Kathy contacted me about creating her wedding invitations early last year.

We’d say to post them <strong>at least 6 months</strong> before the big day. This allows for your guests to book their flights and make the necessary travel and accommodation arrangements as soon as possible.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; POSTING YOUR INVITATIONS</strong></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"image-subtitle sqs-dynamic-text\\\" data-width-percentage=\\\"35.3\\\">\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_11_1496142026617_10845\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-54\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-300x200.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post-1024x683.jpg 1024w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>For a local wedding, we’d recommend you send your full day invitations around <strong>2-3 months </strong>or<strong> 10-15 weeks</strong> in advance of your wedding (minimum). We also highly recommend that you have a “<em>Respond by</em>” date either on your invitations or on your RSVP cards (usually <strong>6 weeks</strong> before your wedding). Some people might ignore it and inevitably you will get some late replies but having a date in mind gives people a deadline to work by. Your venue will usually require your final numbers by a certain date (usually <strong>4 weeks</strong> prior to your wedding) so make sure you keep this in mind too when thinking of when to send your invitations and what dates to have replies by. For example if your wedding was in late September, we’d recommend you send out your invitations at the end of June with a reply date by the beginning of August. This gives your guests ample time to reply.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; EVENING INVITATIONS</strong></p>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1496142026617_104306\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<p>It is <strong>your prerogative</strong>, when you choose to send out your evening reception invitations (if you need them). Sometimes especially if you are worried about making up minimum numbers it is advisable to post your evening invitations slightly later than your full day ones. This means that depending on the number of &#8220;decline&#8221; responses you receive, you can invite some of your evening guests to the full day to make up numbers. To ease the worry about minimum numbers, I’d recommend over-compensating and inviting more to the full day than you actually require to come in the first place. Give or take, around 10-20% of guests you invite will decline, so bear this in mind. You can also send them out at the same time as your full day invitations. This is a good idea for couples that have over estimated their number of full day guests and so who aren’t too worried about meeting minimum numbers. Our advice would be to start with posting out the full day invitations, and you can always send evening invites as and when you wish, usually up to a week before your wedding.</p>\\n<p><strong>&#8211; &#8220;ON THE DAY&#8221; STATIONERY</strong></p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-55\\\" src=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd-249x300.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"249\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" srcset=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd-249x300.jpg 249w, http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/otd.jpg 589w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px\\\" /></p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_6_1496142026617_63773\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\\\" data-block-type=\\\"47\\\">\\n<p>Now I can only speak for Creative Wedding Company, but usually we require your final details at least <strong>4-5 weeks</strong> before your wedding. If you know your menus or details for favour tags etc, (i.e. nothing with names) we’d recommend getting those details to us as soon as possible beforehand so we can have those ready to go for you.</p>\\n<p>Regarding seating plans and place names, we ask that you send us those as soon as you know them so we can start printing them for you. A<strong> minimum of 3 weeks</strong> in advance of your wedding would suffice but the sooner the better really. This gives us ample time to get everything printed and assembled and the finishing touches added for your big day.</p>\\n<p>We will deliver all of your “<em>On the Day</em>” stationery <strong>7-10 days</strong> before your wedding, or earlier in exceptional circumstances.</p>\\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>\\n<div id=\\\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1496142026617_123735\\\" class=\\\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\\\" data-block-type=\\\"2\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"sqs-block-content\\\">\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>12 &#8211; 18 months : </strong>Contact a stationery vendor and finalise ideas with your partner.</li>\\n<li><strong>9 &#8211; 12 months : </strong>Post Save the Dates</li>\\n<li><strong>6</strong> <strong>months (min)</strong> : Post invitations (Destination Weddings)</li>\\n<li><strong>2 &#8211; 3</strong> <strong>months (min)</strong> : Post Full Day (and/or Evening) Invitations <em>N.B.</em> – Put a “<em>Respond By</em>” Date on your RSVP cards for at least 6 weeks before your wedding, as venues usually require final numbers 4 weeks prior to your date.</li>\\n<li><strong>3 &#8211; 5 weeks</strong> &#8211; Send your stationery vendor the necessary final information for your “<em>On the Day</em>” Stationery i.e. Table names, seating plan arrangements, guest names for place cards and so on.</li>\\n<li><strong>7 &#8211; 10 days</strong> – Your &#8220;On the Day&#8221; stationery will be delivered to your house or a required location.
