I thought of couples I knew that were engaged, and immediately thought of our friends Rachael and Brian who had become engaged the month before. Having stayed at Rachael’s house to celebrate she had been discussing themes and initial ideas of what she would like her day to be about. With Rachael being a music teacher, they definitely wanted to make the music a main focus of their day with an art deco, 1920’s theme.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-107 size-large\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-1024x590.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"525\\\" height=\\\"302\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-1024x590.jpg 1024w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-768x443.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>II &#8211; THE INSPIRATION:</h3>\\n<p>I started sketching and came up with the front of the invitations, knowing that I wanted it to be a 5×7 inch bifold card style. I was inspired by the thought of it being almost like a book, as that is how the groom proposed. Another main focus of the design had to be the inclusion of diamonds as again the choice of ring was a key factor in Brian&#8217;s proposal and their story. The frame of the design was inspired by a stage, with Rachael performing with the Belfast Community Gospel Choir regularly.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-103 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"479\\\" height=\\\"720\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d1.jpg 479w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d1-200x300.jpg 200w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>At the top I created an ornament, which to someone outside would seem solely decorative but in reality its supposed to represent two swans as the couples’ nickname is the “Lovebirds”. This later became a motif we used throughout the whole stationery, and they were even kind enough to get it made into a decoration for their cake.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-102 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-4.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"540\\\" height=\\\"663\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-4.jpeg 540w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-4-244x300.jpeg 244w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>III -THE DECISION :</h3>\\n<p>I had created the initial design, without the intention to ever show them what I had designed. I knew a stationer was included in their wedding package so I didn’t want to over step the mark with them being friends of mine. I was proud of what I made and showed my boyfriend (Groomsman at the wedding) and he was very complimentary. Cut to August 2015, and a night out with the happy couple. Rachael asked if I would do something creative for the wedding and I of course said yes! My boyfriend then said “Sure she’s already done your invitations!”. They looked confused and I was nervous as to what they might think of me taking such initiative without their consent. I got out my computer and showed them the design with bated breath. It was instant praise and happiness as I explained each component of the design. The next morning Rachael and Brian cancelled their meeting with the invitation maker they had been assigned, and called me to confirm that they would be enlisting my services! I was scared, excited and absolutely thrilled.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-104 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"479\\\" height=\\\"720\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d2.jpg 479w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d2-200x300.jpg 200w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>IV &#8211; THE PROCESS:</h3>\\n<p>After consulting with the bride, groom and Rachael’s lovely mother Carol, we fine-tuned our ideas. With the reception being in the Renaissance Suite in the Galgorm Hotel and Spa, we knew we wanted to continue the art deco theme but with a modern twist to suit the location. Our colour choice was grey on pale ivory with silver foil details. I had to out-source the printing of the invitations and orders of service covers due to the foiling, as I was limited to my printing options at the time. I chose Kaizen Print, based on Lisburn Road, Belfast, who were extremely helpful and did a fabulous job.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-105 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CREATIVE-WEDDING-COMPANY-Donal-Dherty-Photography.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"960\\\" height=\\\"640\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CREATIVE-WEDDING-COMPANY-Donal-Dherty-Photography.jpg 960w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CREATIVE-WEDDING-COMPANY-Donal-Dherty-Photography-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CREATIVE-WEDDING-COMPANY-Donal-Dherty-Photography-768x512.jpg 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\\\" /></p>\\n<p>I  printed the rest of the necessary stationery in my studio, including the insides of the orders of service, the place cards, seating plans and table names and some other decorative pieces too such as welcome signs and tags for the wedding favours. I was so happy with how everything turned out and as I have been saying from the start, it was an absolute privilege to do this for Rachael and Brian as they are such good friends of ours. I cannot get over the kind words from everyone at the wedding about my work. It means a lot to me. It really was a magical day and I hope they loved every second of it. It truly was their own and they had their day their way.</p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-106 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d3.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" height=\\\"480\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d3.jpg 720w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/d3-300x200.jpg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>WISHING YOU LOTS OF LOVE, HAPPINESS AND LAUGHTER TOGETHER.</h3>\\n<h3>LOUISE XX</h3>\\n<h3>CREDITS: STATIONERY PHOTOGRAPHS BY<strong> <a href=\\\"https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">CWC </a></strong>&amp; <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/donaldohertyphotography/?pnref=story\\\">DONAL DOHERTY</a> </strong>| WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY BY <strong><a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/donaldohertyphotography/?pnref=story\\\">DONAL DOHERTY</a></strong></h3>\\n<h3>OTHER:<strong> <a href=\\\"http://kaizenprint.co.uk/\\\">KAIZEN PRINT</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.galgorm.com/\\\">GALGORM RESORT &amp; SPA</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/BCGC.biz/?fref=ts\\\">BELFAST COMMUNITY GOSPEL </a></strong></h3>\\n<h1 class=\\\"text-align-center\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/wedding-stationery/\\\">have your big day, your way</a></h1>\\n\"}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"5c32dd66-5f58-5ae5-8fbc-ff98be434e5d\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---weddings-rachael-brian-22-10-2016-b8e0ae9723109581f9b0.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"wordpressPost\":{\"title\":\"RACHAEL &#038; BRIAN 22/10/2016\",\"content\":\"<h1 class=\\\"text-align-center\\\">Rachael and Brian</h1>\\n<h3 class=\\\"text-align-center\\\">22ND OCTOBER 2016 / ST CANICES CHURCH, EGLINTON &amp; THE GALGORM RESORT &amp; SPA, BALLYMENA</h3>\\n<h3 class=\\\"text-align-center\\\">MODERN MUSICAL ART DECO WEDDING STATIONERY</h3>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-100 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-6.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"750\\\" height=\\\"499\\\" srcset=\\\"https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-6.jpeg 750w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-6-300x200.jpeg 300w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\\\" /></p>\\n<h3>I &#8211; THE BEGINNING:</h3>\\n<p>Once upon a time I decided to pursue wedding stationery as part of my illustration work and one day started designing mockups for fun.
