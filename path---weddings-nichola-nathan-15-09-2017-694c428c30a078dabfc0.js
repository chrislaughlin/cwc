I wanted to keep everything classic but modern, matching the couple&#8217;s minimalistic style. Deep eggplant purples and greys complimented each other matching in with the bridal party colours. I then adorned the suite with a silver shimmer belly band to keep everything together nicely and to add a wee bit of sparkle of course!</p>\n<p>I also had the pleasure of creating some of their &#8220;On the Day&#8221; Stationery too. Keeping with the romantic and soft theme, I created a simple seating plan using board and purple silk draped at the sides, which added a touch of elegance.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84 size-large" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-1024x1015.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="520" srcset="https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-1024x1015.jpg 1024w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-300x297.jpg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-768x761.jpg 768w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170705_141123-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>\n<p>For their table numbers, Nichola and Nathan wanted a &#8220;When we were this age&#8221; theme, and so with the help of their mums, Sadie &amp; Mandy, I collected old photos of Nathan and Nichola to use in the designs. It was so much fun to go through all the photographs and I really loved how they turned out!</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83 size-large" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170910_113416-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170910_113416-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170910_113416-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/20170910_113416-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>\n<p>I want to personally thank Nathan and Nichola for letting me be a small part of their big day! You two are made for each other and I hope you have a fantastic life together!
