Being October, they wanted to keep their stationery very muted with a rustic and seasonal vibe. I hand drew autumn leaves from which I then created a pattern to adorn the invitations. Kraft paper was used throughout providing texture and warmth. A belly band with a twine bow tied everything together (literally). The result was a suite that was full of charm and delight and I hope this feeling translated across to their special day. I was honoured to be a part of it and wish both the bride &amp; groom the best of luck for the future!</p>\n<p>LOVE LOUISE X X</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76 size-large" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-2-1024x543.jpeg" alt="" width="525" height="278" srcset="https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-2-1024x543.jpeg 1024w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-2-300x159.jpeg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-2-768x407.jpeg 768w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-2.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-77 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="675" srcset="https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-2.jpeg 1000w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-2-300x203.jpeg 300w, https://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3-2-768x518.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>\n<h3>CREDITS &#8211; STATIONERY PHOTOGRAPHS :<strong> <a href="https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/">CWC</a> </strong>| VENUE :<strong> <a href="http://www.solishotels.com/lougheskecastle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LOUGH ESKE</a></strong></h3>\n<h1 class="text-align-center"><a href="https://www.creativeweddingcompany.com/wedding-stationery/">have your big day, your way</a></h1>\n'}},pathContext:{id:"dcb333c5-7891-54a3-a113-44364b907b72"}}}});
