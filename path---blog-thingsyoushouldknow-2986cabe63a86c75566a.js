What now? Well, you have a wedding to plan!</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-30 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1.gif" alt="" width="500" height="228" /></p>\n<p>I have always loved weddings, even before I got engaged last November to my fiancé Chris. Planning your wedding can be both a pain and a pleasure, so here are some things that might help you along the way from a girl who&#8217;s doing it herself.</p>\n<p>1 – <strong>You aren’t going to please everyone so stop trying</strong></p>\n<p>Weddings are very special. They bring a lot of groups of people from a lot different backgrounds together in one place. In turn not everyone will have the same taste and the thought of anyone not being happy at your wedding can make you pretty anxious. I know this from my own experience especially. Music, food, and the craic (aka in most cases alcohol). These are the things that particularly matter to your guests and where they can find common ground. Keep these as priorities, to keep faces happy. In saying this, you need to realise that you can’t meet everyone else’s expectations of what a “wedding” is. So what if you want to ride in on a llama or have a black wedding dress, go for it.  Stop overthinking what people will think. That’s a road to nowhere, and you will waste time worrying over nothing as it can’t be helped. Everyone has opinions but you don’t need to take them ALL into consideration. It’s your day. Everyone at your wedding loves you and just want YOU to be happy.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-31 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.gif" alt="" width="350" height="197" /></p>\n<p>2- <strong>Things are more expensive than you think</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;So you have a budget? Double it.&#8221; This is what I’ve seen written loads of times in other blogs, and in some cases it is true, but doesn’t necessarily apply to every wedding. You need to be a bit savvy if you do want to stick to your initial budget that you and your partner came up with 2 days after you got engaged. Things cost money. Lots more than you’d expect. From my own experience I can safely say that custom work is going to be a bit more expensive than just buying in the shop, due to the special nature of it. The extra expense can be worthwhile depending what you’re willing to spend money on. Figure out what’s important to you, and budget accordingly. You can save money on the other stuff.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-32 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/3.gif" alt="" width="475" height="295" /></p>\n<p>3- <strong>You have to prioritise</strong></p>\n<p>When planning a wedding, it is easy to get 5 steps ahead of yourself and start thinking about “On the Day” gifts for your bridal party before you’ve even asked them. (Look at me pretending that I didn’t do this… of course I did!).  But I&#8217;ve realised it is important to start big and go small as you can waste so much time worrying about the details. Dates, venues, your bridal party, guest list and numbers &#8211; Think of the big things before thinking small. Accommodation – that is a priority that is sometimes overlooked. Book early to avoid disappointment. Consider your timescale also. Figure out when you’ll need certain things and book accordingly. (e.g. If it is a foreign wedding, you may need to send out the invitations sooner than usual to allow people to book flights etc.) Don’t forget to see the woods before the trees.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-1.gif" alt="" width="632" height="323" /></p>\n<p>4- <strong>It’s not too soon to start buying things.</strong></p>\n<p>If you see something that you like for your wedding you are allowed to buy it. Nobody can dictate how you plan your wedding. This may sound hypocritical, but hear me out. I had been engaged 1 month. My venue was booked, bridal party asked etc, and I saw bridesmaid dresses I fell in love with. I asked for necessary sizes and I bought them outright. If you feel the fear of “losing them nearer the time” that’s enough reason to part with cash 18 months before your big day. But really you can start buying whenever you want. That was just my story, but I want to get the point across to not let anyone make you feel guilty about buying things for your wedding early. You’re allowed to be excited, but just be smart and know that you won’t change your mind nearer the time before you spend your money.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-35 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5.gif" alt="" width="500" height="243" /></p>\n<p>5 – <strong>Ask for help</strong></p>\n<p>Wedding planning can be overwhelming especially if you don’t have a clear idea in your head of what you want. It can take a lot of time and effort and emails and phone calls, but remember that there are two of you in the picture. It’s very easy for brides (myself included) to take the reins when it comes to wedding prep, but don’t forget that your betrothed can help too. Let them make phone calls, and do some research themselves too. You don’t have to take everything on just your shoulders. Spread the weight. Your bridal party and parents are great too for ideas and brainstorming sessions. Pop the prosecco, we’ve got a wedding to plan!</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-36 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/6.gif" alt="" width="498" height="221" /></p>\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_34279" class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2">\n<div class="sqs-block-content">\n<p>6 – <strong>Finding the perfect wedding dress is really hard (impossible even)</strong></p>\n<p>Where do I start? I think this section will be an entire blog post in itself one day so watch this space.  If there was ever a time I wish I’d changed my discipline to textiles in art college it is now. Dress shopping is hard. And if you’re fickle about fashion like me, it is nearly impossible. Bear in mind that a majority of bridal shops carry (very) small sizes, and so for us “normal” (size 14 UK) girls, wedding dress shopping can be an “experience” to say the least. (I think the circulation has finally returned to my arms now). The best advice I can give you so far is to do your research of bridal shops before you go and to stick to your guns. Nobody knows your shape better than you. Not the sales woman, nor your entourage. You will also look good in a lot of dresses. But if you don’t FEEL amazing in it, don’t buy it.  You (we) will find the “one” eventually.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_34856" class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready" data-block-type="5">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1604" class="sqs-block-content">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1603" class="image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1602" class="intrinsic">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1601" class="image-block-wrapper has-aspect-ratio" data-description=""><img class="alignnone wp-image-37 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8.gif" alt="" width="500" height="283" /></div>\n</div>\n<div data-description="">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7 &#8211; <strong>Read reviews and ask around.</strong></p>\n<p>If shopping online, there will be brands and online shops that you will have never heard of before.

This is especially good for smaller weddings where you can ask your baker to do the bottom tier or middle tier as a faux cake so it still has the visual of a larger wedding cake without the waste of a real cake. (How many times can you say cake in a sentence??) You don’t actually even need a real cake if you don’t want to. <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-to-order/wedding-cakes/wedding-cakes/savoury-wedding-cakes?intid=FW_WDCakes_Tile6_SavouryWDCakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheese wheels</a> are another trendy alternative to the traditional three tier for those of a more savoury inclination. <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-to-order/wedding-cakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M&amp;S</a> also do an affordable range of wedding cakes you can assemble yourself, for those brides and grooms on a budget and wanting to DIY.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_42715" class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready" data-block-type="5">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1638" class="sqs-block-content">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1637" class="image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1636" class="intrinsic">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1635" class="image-block-wrapper has-aspect-ratio" data-description=""> <img class="alignnone wp-image-39 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/10.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></div>\n<div data-description="">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9- <strong>Get rings that will stand the test of time</strong></p>\n<p>My engagement ring is white gold and I adore it. Little did I realise that most wedding rings need dipped to maintain shine. You can do this for around £30 in your jewellers, but just keep this in mind when picking out your bands. Also consider the thickness of your band as thinner bands could “nip”, and break in years to come (which is what happened to a relative of mine).  Sterling silver and titanium are two affordable and overlooked hardwearing metals that provide the style as well as the longevity.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-40 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/11.gif" alt="" width="498" height="201" /></p>\n<p>10 – <strong>Pinterest is BAE, but half of the stuff isn’t real</strong></p>\n<p>Hi my name is Louise and I am addicted to <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a>. I recently came across an <a href="http://www.shefinds.com/2012/10-reasons-not-to-plan-your-wedding-on-pinterest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on why not to plan your wedding on Pinterest, the main reason being that most of the weddings on there make you (me) green with envy and could potentially leave us with unrealistic expectations of what our weddings will be like. Some of the weddings on there are unreal…. literally. It has been said that many of these weddings are just fabricated images that have been designed for editorial purposes.  This doesn’t surprise me really as we have all seen the hilarious “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nataliebrown/pinterest-craft-fails-that-are-never-not-funny?utm_term=.wjxVkYODJ#.dxj0dY618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest Fails</a>” articles on the internet. Pinterest glamorises everything to look so easy and amazing, which we all know is not realistic. But the thing is in my opinion, that Pinterest is fun! And it can be useful as shops (like <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/cwcstationery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ourselves</a>) use it as a platform to post their products and the curated content means that you might find something you never thought of before. I will not stop anyone from using Pinterest as a source of inspiration for their wedding as I myself have currently over 3000 pins in my wedding board. (I seriously think I have a problem…). Even if the images are fake, a girl can dream so just keep pinning &lt;3</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-41 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12.gif" alt="" width="500" height="270" /></p>\n<p>11 &#8211; <strong>Like me, you will have bridezilla moments. Lots of them.</strong></p>\n<p>A wedding is a big deal. Tensions will run high. You will not be able to find the perfect tie for your groomsmen. You will cry… I have had moments where I catch myself freaking out about the smallest thing. My wedding is important to me as i&#8217;m sure yours is to you. I’m naturally quite an anxious person. Add the pressure of perfection and I have had too many mini breakdowns about my wedding than I’d care to admit. So what have I done? I have let go and have realised that things will go wrong and that is okay. I know I will have more freak-outs, but to be honest, having SOME bridezilla moments is healthy as it just shows you care! As I’ve said if you feel yourself freaking out over the smallest things, just step back and realise what is really important. Your wedding day is about you and your partner, and celebrating your love. In the grand scheme of things, a tie colour doesn’t matter. And if something does go wrong on the day, won’t it make a pretty good story?</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-42 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/13.gif" alt="" width="426" height="240" /></p>\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_57876" class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2">\n<div class="sqs-block-content">\n<p>12 – <strong>Your parents matter but it isn’t their wedding.</strong></p>\n<p>Just like we’ve been planning our wedding for years in our heads, so have they in theirs. I have been lucky in the sense that my parents have been very open to my ideas. However, I know that there are a lot of you out there that will clash with your parents over some things and will need to compromise on others to keep the peace, especially if they are contributing financially to the day. Communication is key in the parents/wedding relationship &#8211; e.g. If you’re eloping – tell them. If you’re not having a religious ceremony – let them know. No one wants to fall out with anyone and if you are happy, they will be too so long as you make your intentions known from the start.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_58458" class="sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image sqs-text-ready" data-block-type="5">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1706" class="sqs-block-content">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1705" class="image-block-outer-wrapper layout-caption-below design-layout-inline">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1704" class="intrinsic">\n<div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1521991017628_1703" class="image-block-wrapper has-aspect-ratio" data-description=""><img class="alignnone wp-image-43 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/14.gif" alt="" width="500" height="274" /></div>\n</div>\n<div data-description="">\n<div id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1494962842908_61546" class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2">\n<div class="sqs-block-content">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>13 – <strong>Don’t forget about the Mother of your Partner.</strong></p>\n<p>She is excited too, and can help – a lot! I’ve heard of weddings before where the mother of the groom didn’t even know the bridesmaid colours until the day before the wedding. Not cool! If there is tension in the family use the wedding to break the ice. If there is no tension then there is no excuse to not include your MOP (Mother of your Partner) in the planning as well.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-44 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/15.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>\n<p>14 – <strong>It’s okay to be obsessed with your wedding (within reason)</strong></p>\n<p>A wedding can easily take over your life. You’re totally allowed to be excited as these are very exciting times but it is easy to go overboard. You will end up boring your friends and family if it’s all you ever talk about so just remember to take a break every so often and focus on something else.  It’s okay to be obsessed with your wedding. I am with mine. But I know when to stop and talk about something else. (You also don’t want to give too many details away to everyone just yet&#8230;)</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-45 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/16.gif" alt="" width="480" height="264" /></p>\n<p>15– <strong>It’s okay to not invite people.</strong></p>\n<p>There can be a certain level of personal politics when it comes to deciding on your guest list. You were invited to your work friend&#8217;s wedding last year, but then if you invite her then you have to invite this person and then this person and so on. If you don’t want them there, don’t invite them. Easier said than done I know, as you may have to send out a few courtesy wedding invitations to keep the peace, but really in reality if you don’t want someone there, the likelihood is that they’ll probably not want to go. Have a discussion with your parents and each other about who you should invite, but know that you don’t have to invite certain people (even if they are family) if it will make either of you feel uncomfortable.  Only have the people there that you both want to be there. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Also if you don’t want to have children at your wedding, kindly talk to their parents beforehand and explain your wishes, so they can make the necessary arrangements for them to be looked after on the date.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-46 size-full" src="http://www.cwc.liffydesigns.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/17.gif" alt="" width="500" height="255" /></p>\n<p>16 – <strong>It’s your day so have it your way.</strong></p>\n<p>There are various ways you can put your own stamp on your wedding day, but probably the most effective is your wedding stationery.
